Mapping to different scvi-hub atlas versions
----------------------------

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on mapping data to a specific version of an scvi-hub atlas. 
By default, all users have  access to the latest versions of all scvi-hub atlases trained with scVI and scANVI.
However, in the scenario that a user would like to map their data to an earlier version of an atlas, the user can follow the steps outlined below.
In summary, these steps involve downloading the desired atlas version using the notebook below and uploading the atlas to the ArchMap webite for mapping. 

1. Download the desired atlas version using this `notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/155fYroA0aCa9IUl80rvzy9L2RY_Hd1aT>`_.

2. Upload the h5ad file and model.pt file to ArchMap. For detail on how to do this see :doc:`beta_feature/index.rst`.  

3. After the atlas has been successfully uploaded and reviewed by our team, you can begin your mapping.
